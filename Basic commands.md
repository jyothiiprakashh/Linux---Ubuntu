In Linux, every command typically consists of three parts
Command – Options – Arguments


## Commands: Commands are the keywords that perform specific actions or execute programs.
## Options : Options are used to modify the behavior of a command and to get customized output.
## Arguments : Arguments are the targets on which the command operates. These can be files, directories, paths, users, etc.


You will understand these parts more clearly as we continue practicing.



The basic structure of the command is as follows,

[Command] [Option] [Argument]  ---->   [ls] [-l] [/home/user1]  ----> 

{ls -l /home/user1} -----> (Original command)

* Here "ls" is command, "-l" is option, "/home/user1" is argument.
Which means we are listing the files line by line inside the user1 directory located in the /home directory.
ls - listing  ;  -l - Long listing line by line  ;  /home/user1 - inside home directory user1 directory is available.


Commands

* whoami - username of the current usre

* calandar - prints calandar
* uptime - computer on time

Now, we will use these commands to learn how they work.
