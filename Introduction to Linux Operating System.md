# Basic definitions

Operating System (OS): 
* An operating system is the main software that controls your computer.
* It helps you run programs, manage files, and use hardware like your keyboard, mouse, and hard drive.

Kernel:
* The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It connects the hardware and software.
* It manages memory, processes, and devices like CPU and hard disk. It works in the background and you usually don't see it directly.

CLI (Command Line Interface):
* CLI is a text-based way to use your computer. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you type commands using the keyboard.
* It's powerful and fast once you learn it.

Terminal:
The terminal is the program where you type and run commands. It's like a window that lets you use the CLI.

Shell:
* A shell is a program that takes your commands from the terminal and gives them to the operating system to do the work. It also shows you the result.
* It acts as interface between user & kernel.
* It takes input from user through command line interface and executes by kernel.
* Bash (Bourne again shell), csh ( C- shell), zsh ( Z- shell), sh (Bourne Shell) 

Bash:
Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell. It is the most commonly used shell in Linux. It's where you type your commands, create scripts, and automate tasks.
